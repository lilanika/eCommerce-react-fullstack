React is a single page App framework. Its used to create single page spplication. What I mean by that is the browser initially reads this single index.html file. 

ReactDOM has a method called Render where it takes our main app compontent, wich is an app compontent. 
and puts into whetever we put in the document.getElement.ById('root).
Every custom compontent we will create we will take in the app.js
